# Introduction to Embedded Rust

## Getting Started

Build the Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t env-embedded-rust  .
```

To run:

Linux, macOS, Windows (PowerShell):

```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 -v "$(pwd)/workspace:/home/student/workspace" -w /workspace env-embedded-rust
```

## Initialize rustlings

If you would like to practice rust with the official [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises, you should navigate to the *workspace/* directory (in the container) and initialize *rustlings*:

```sh
cd /home/student/workspace
rustlings init
```

To start *rustlings* or pick up where you left off:

```sh
cd /home/student/workspace/rustlings
rustlings --manual-run
```

> **Note**: by default, *rustlings* uses *rust-analyzer* to watch for file changes to check if your code works or not. This sometimes struggles in a container, so I recommend using `--manual-run` to disable this feature. It just means you need to press `r` in the *rustlings* prompt when you want to check your code.
